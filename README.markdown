iOS-JSON-Performance
====================

This project is a quick benchmark of JSON libraries for iOS.
I did this project because sometimes I've been questioned about which one is the best library for JSON deserialization/serialization so I decided to create a quick project to test all of them with different scenarios.

I used the following libraries:
- [SBJson](http://stig.github.com/json-framework) - *Previously known as json-framework*<br/>
- [JSONKit](https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit)<br/>
- [NextiveJSON](https://github.com/nextive/NextiveJson)<br/>
- [TouchJSON](https://github.com/TouchCode/TouchJSON)<br/>
- [NSJSONSerialization](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSJSONSerialization_Class/Reference/Reference.html) - *Public API since iOS5*

I also created a [post in my blog about it](http://bonto.ch/blog/2011/12/06/json-libraries-for-ios-comparison/). Please feel free to add comments, suggestion and criticism to help me improving this basic project.
